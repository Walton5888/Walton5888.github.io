# Using Digital Ocean Droplet to Create WireGuard VPN via Docker
## Step 1: Create a Digtial Ocean Account

Visit this link to create your account: https://www.digitalocean.com/

## Step 2: Create a VM (Droplet)

* Choose the create VM option
* Choose Ubuntu 20.04 as your OS
* Don't choose any add-ons
* Choose the $6 (1GB) plan
* Set a password

## Step 3: SSH into the VM 

* Access the terminal on your computer
* Type this in: ssh root@<your_ip_address>
* Replace your_ip_address with your actual IP address
* Type in your password, and you should have access to your droplet

## Step 4: Setting up Wireguard:

* Start with the following command to build a wireguard directory: mkdir -p ~/wireguard/
* Then, type in the following command to make the directory for the wireguard configuation: mkdir -p ~/wireguard/config/
* Then, make a docker compose file for wireguard with the following command: nano ~/wireguard/docker-compose.yml
* Paste the following content into the file:
version: '3.3'
services:
  wireguard:
    container_name: wireguard
    image: linuxserver/wireguard
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Menominee
      - SERVERURL=164.90.149.112
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=pc1,pc2,phone1
      - PEERDNS=auto
      - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.0.0.0
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./config/
        target: /config/
      - type: bind
        source: /lib/modules
        target: /lib/modules
    restart: always
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
 * Note: you will need to change the server url to your droplet's IP address, and TZ to your timezone.
 
 ## Step 5: Running Wireguard
 
 * Type in the following command to enter your wireguard directory: cd ~/wireguard/
 * Type in the following command to run your docker compose file: docker-compose up -d
 * Wireguard should be running now.
 
 ## Step 6: Connecting Wireguard VPN to a Smartphone.
 
 * Go to your phone's app store and download the Wireguard app.
 * Return to your terminal on your computer.
 * Type this command into your terminal to generate the private key: wg genkey
 * This should generate a private key.
 * Type this command into your terminal to generate the public key: wg pubkey your_private_key
 * Replace your_private_key with the key you were provided.
 * Then, type this in to create your wireguard configuration file: nano wg0.conf
 * In the file, put your credentials (public, private key) in the file. Your file should look something like this: 
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <server_private_key>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
[Peer]
PublicKey = <client_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
* Note: Put your own keys into the PrivateKey and Public Key sections
* To get the encoding capabilites to generate a QR code for your app, type in this command: sudo apt-get install qrencode
* Type in this command to generate the QR code: qrencode -t ansiutf8 < wg0.conf
* Before proceeding any further, check the IP address on your phone by going to this link: https://ipleak.net/

* Now, Open the Wireguard app on your phone
* Place your phone's camera at the QR code in your terminal.
* You should now have access to the Wire Guard tunnel on your phone.
* Ensure that the VPN is activated on your smartphone by checking your phone's settings.

* As you can see, the address is different since the VPN has been activated on your phone.

## Step 7: Verifying Wireguard Connection on Your Computer

* Start by first checking the IP address on your computer by visiting this link: https://ipleak.net/

* Now, install the WireGuard application onto your computer.
* Open the app and import your wg0.config file that you did earlier.
* Verify the connection of the VPN
